Introduction to Database System

- Database - storage of data
	    Organised Collection of Related data
		stored on disk
		accessible by many concurrent users

- DBMS - Database management system 
	set of programs which manages the database

- RDBMS - Relational database management system
		Dr E F Codd 1970
		Relation - 2 D Table

	- Collection of Objects/ Relations
	- set of operators to act on those relations
	- maintaining integrity of data


- ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram

Basic model which helps in designing the database

3 components
  -- Entity - something for which info needs to be stored
  e.g - Customers, Suppliers, Employees, Departments, Orders, Products
	Entity will become table in your database
  
  -- Attribute - something which describes the entity
	Employee : Employeeid, name, job_profile, salary, department....

  -- Relationship - Association between the entities

		1 - 1
		Employee : Adhaar_Card_dtls
		
		1 - M	( 1 : M , 1: 1)

		University : Student
		1	: M
		1 	:1
		Department : Employee


		M - M

		(1 : M
		 M : 1)


		Book : Author
		1      :  M
		M        :  1

		Student : Subjects_enrolled
		Employee : Project
		Book : Author



Constraints
-------------

rules enforced on tables to maintain integrity of data

NOT NULL

UNIQUE	    - 	no duplicates
		1 table - Many Unique keys
		may contain null values

PRIMARY KEY - UNIQUE + NOT NULL      
		1 table - 1 PK

FOREIGN KEY  - Reference to the Primary key of another table / or same table as well 
              ( to apply the relationship)

- can contain null value
- can contain duplicate value
- can contain only the values present in primary key column or it can contain null


CHECK		- User defined constraint
		Join_date Date CHECK ( join_date>'01-JAN-2000' )
		Gender varchar2(1) CHECK(gender in ('M','F'))

DEFAULT     - to specify default value for a column

		Join_date DATE DEFAULT '01-JAN-10'


Implementation of relationships in database



PK of One side table - Foreign key in Many side table

1
Department
Departmentid(PK) , name ..........	
101				
102				
103				
104

M
Employee
PK
Emp id  name ..........	passportid (FK), Departmentid(FK)
1	AAA		10		101
2	Abhijeet	40		102
3	kalyani		50		102		
4	B		20		null
5	C		null		null

Passport (1:1 with employee- can add any one 's primary key as forign key in another table)

3rd table, bridge table /junction table

Types of SQL Statements
---------------------------

DDL 	: Data Definition Language
	CREATE
	ALTER
	DROP
	TRUNCATE0
	RENAME
DML	: Data Manipulation Language	
	INSERT
	UPDATE
	DELETE
DCL	: Data Control Language
	GRANT
	REVOKE
TCL	: Transaction Control Language
	COMMIT
	ROLLBACK
	SAVEPOINT
Data Retrieval - SELECT


DDL statements
------------------

	-- Auto Commit


CREATE

ALTER
       	- to add new column	ADD
	- to modify existing column	MODIFY ( to change the size or data type of column)
	- to remove a column	Drop column
	- to add/remove the constraints	Add constraint, drop constraint
	- to rename a column		rename column

DROP
	to remove the table/object from the table
	all the data from that table will also be removed

TRUNCATE
	Truncate table table_name

	to remove entire data from the table
	structure of the table will remain

RENAME
	Rename a table or any database object

	Rename old_table to new_table_name;



DML statements


- INSERT : to add records in the table
- UPDATE : to modify the data within the data
- DELETE : to remove records


INSERT

	INSERT INTO table_name [(column_list)]
	VALUES (values );


-- Substitution variable
			&VariableName  (works as substitution)


Common errors that can occur during execution of Insert statement
- Mandatory value missing for a not null column
- Duplicate value violates unique constraint
- Foreign key constraint violated
- check constraint violated
- datatype mismatch


UPDATE statement
----------------------
to modify the data within the table

using a single update statement , user can modify multiple rows as well as   columns at a time


Update table_name
set col=value, col2=value2 ..... : which column value user wants to update
[ Where condition ]		 : Which rows user wants to update
-- as where is optional - if where in not mentioned then valu will get set for whole column

DELETE
-------

to remove data from the table
      
DELETE from table_name
[where condition ]



TRUNCATE	- Auto Commit - DDL statements
		  all records will be deleted in one go

DELETE		- Commit/Rollback - DML statements
		  to specify which rows user wants to delete	
		 delete all / few rows from table

Common err - Integrity constraint violated; child records found
If any one is deleting 100 from dept ey referenced in Employee table
then there might be above error
dept
deptid
100
200
400
700

Employee
empid 	deptid
1	100
2	400
3	100




SELECT statement                        
----------------------


	- all the sql queries are not case insensative
	- values in the table are case sensative, format sesitive


SELECT * / column_names
FROM table

Arithmatic oprs  + - * /

Column alais
	alternative name for existing column in the table /calculated column. should be single word
         so use _ to join two words.

 alais in " "  : to make it case sensative, to add spaces, any special characters

Concatenation operator ||

WHERE clause
		to specify row level filter condition

Comparison operators

	Basic
		= > < >= <= <>
	Advance
		IN		to compare with list of values
		BETWEEN		to compare within range
		LIKE		wildcard search
				_ any single character
				% any 0 or more characters

		IS NULL


Logical operator
	to incoporate multiple conditions in where clause
	AND
	OR

	to reverse the condtion
	NOT

Not in
Not between
not like
is not null



Sorting of data
	ORDER BY clause

ASC - ascending 	- default
DESC - descending order


Order by clause can contain
		Numeric column, date column , character column 	

Order by clause 
	column name, column alais, column position

Order by clause is the only clause in select statement where we can use column alais
